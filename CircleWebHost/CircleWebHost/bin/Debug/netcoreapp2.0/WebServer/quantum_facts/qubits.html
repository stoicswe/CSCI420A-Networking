        <p>The most basic and essential difference between classical and quantum computing is bytes, the way in which data is handled. In a classical sense a classical bit can either be a zero or a one value, whereas a quantum bit (also known as a qubit) is either probably in the zero or one position. That essential difference enables the ability to exploit and manipulate the laws of quantum mechanics to compute data. A qubit can be defined by the following (with p_0 and p_1 as the probabilities of zero and one respectively):</p>
        <br>
        <p>(p_0 / p_1) |0> = (1 / 0) |1> = (0 / 1)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Qubits, because of the characteristic of having a probability of zero and one as their value, can also be in a state other than zero or one. This arbitrary state is known as superposition. One well-known superposition in the quantum computing field is the bell state, which is denoted as:</p>
        <br>
        <p>1/sqrt(2) * (|0> + |1>)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note that the state of a cubit is a complex number, so to measure the probabilities of the qubit, the following property is used:</p>
        <br>
        <p>|a^2| + |b^2| = 1</p>
        <br>
        <p>Where a is the state of the first possible state of the qubit and b is the second state of the qubit. The way qubit states are measured changes slightly, however, due to another essential property of cubits: entanglement. Unlike classical bits, which cannot affect each other and are totally independent at all times, qubits can be paired together and affect each other when two or more qubits are entangled together. This phenomenon is a quantum mechanical property of atoms, one that is not entirely understood, however, it has been learned to be exploited to teleport data and to compress data. With an entangled qubit, we can teleport two classical bits via a technique known as super dense coding, which is a whole other level of complexity that does not fit the contents of this proposal.</p>
