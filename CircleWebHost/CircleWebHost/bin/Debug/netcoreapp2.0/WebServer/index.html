        <p>Quantum computing is the future for computers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because of the massive explosion of digital data, there have been new methods that have been developed to interact and analyze the copious quantities of the so-called “big data.” Machine learning, a solution to the big data problem, has enabled data scientists to create, develop, and implement complex algorithms that analyze data efficiently, with speed. One particular method that a machine can learn to perform a specific task is by use of a neural network. Since the first development of a neural network, the applications for it has increased drastically as the digital data being generated has grown. One such application for a neural network is known as Hebbian learning, a learning in which a Hopfield neural network is used to analyze patterns in data and recognize those patterns in unknown or “new” data sets. A more common known application of Hebbian learning is facial recognition. Even though these developments have been made in the artificial intelligence and big data fields, there has been complications due to the sheer amounts of digital data being generated. Simply put, we cannot handle the data any longer efficiently. This pressing need for more parallel computing power has driven the research behind quantum computing and quantum applications.</p>
